# Best Practices 

## Components

### Button vs. Link, Tab, and Menu

- **Link:** use when the action is positioned inside a text and/or requires less visual prominence.
- **Tab:** use when the action is to alternate between related views within the same container.
- **Menu:** include the action in a Menu when it’s rarely used or repeated multiple times in a list.

## Variants

### Accent, Muted, Plain and Critical

- Use `primary` for frequently triggered actions, `secondary` for occasionally triggered actions, and `tertiary` for rarely triggered actions.
- Use `critical` or `criticalTertiary` for irreversible actions. Actions should be reversible whenever possible and not require the critical color.
- Use `tertiary` when the same action is repeated on the container, such as for each list item.
- Keep only one `primary` action visible at a time.

### Normal and Large

Use the `large` size for all `primary` actions. Use the `normal` size for `secondary` and `tertiary` actions that are not next to `large` actions.

## Position

### Position in a container

- Right align and vertically center actions. For example, in the header or footer of a Modal.
- In a horizontal list, order actions from `tertiary` to `primary`. In a vertical list, from `primary` to `tertiary`.
- Use a `secondary` action alone, next to one `primary` action, or next to one or more `tertiary` actions.
- When a `tertiary` or `tertiaryCritical` action should be aligned with other content, use the Bleed component to ignore the action box and align it based on its icon and/or label.
- In a form, left-align actions that modify content and right-align those that submit content.
- Don't include more than one `secondary` action in a group of actions.

## Behavior

### Disabled state

- Use a disabled action only if it becomes enabled in some condition. For example, a *Save* action that is only enabled when edits have been made.
- When the reason why an action is disabled might be unclear, leave the action enabled and show a modal explaining it when triggered.
- Don't display a Tooltip when hovering a disabled action.

### Loading state

- Use only for actions that usually take more than 1s and less than 5s to process.
- Don't show loading or progress indicators for actions that take less than 1s to process.
- If the action takes more than 5s to process, display progress feedback in an overlay.

### Confirmation modal

- Display a ConfirmationModal when the action is irreversible. For example, a *Delete* action where it isn't possible to restore the item from the trash.
- Display a ConfirmationModal when the action takes considerable time to undo. For example, a *Publish* action that takes time and can’t be canceled while in progress.

## Content

### Label

- Reuse existing labels.
- Always include a verb in the infinitive followed by an object. For example, *Create product*.
- Use a verb that reflects the exact action. For example, use *Publish* instead of *Confirm*.
- Use sentence case but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don’t use punctuation, more than three words, or personal pronouns.

### Icon and Label

- Include an icon before the label whenever the action can be represented by an icon, especially when it's part of a group of actions.
- If the button opens a page in a new tab, include an `IconArrowUpRightSmall` after the label.

### Icon-only

- Hide the label only when the icon is easily recognizable by itself. For example, the Close, Forward, and Back icons.
- Don’t leave a Button without an alternative label. Always add one in the `aria-label` prop.
- If there is no easily recognizable icon, prefer to position the action inside a Menu. Don’t use a Tooltip to display the label.

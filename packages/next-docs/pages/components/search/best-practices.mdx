# Best Practices

## Components

### Search vs. Filter, Text Input, and Combobox

- **Filter:** use when the content can be classified in predefined options that can be chosen as criteria to filter items.
- **Text Input:** use to fill free form content that will be submitted as part of a form.
- **Combobox (single or multiple):** use to contextually filter a list of options and then submit the selected ones as part of a form.

## Position

### Position in a container

Considering left-to-right interfaces, follow these recommendations:

- Position the Search directly above the content that will be filtered.
- The Search should always be in the top left of a container.
- Use the DataView component to correctly position the Search.
- Don't position the Search in the header of a container.

## Behavior

### Disabled state

Avoid using a disabled Search. Use the DataView component instead, which automatically hides the Search input when the list is empty.

### Loading state

- Use a loading Search when the search takes more than a second to process.
- Don’t block merchants from editing the input during the loading state.
- The search process shouldn’t take longer than five seconds.

### Feedback in a list

- The loading state with a spinner in the Search field should be the only feedback while the search is being processed. After the results load, the Search field should go back to its default state.
- Maintain the previous results visible until the new ones finish loading.
- Don’t show a Skeleton when processing a search.

### Clearing or persisting results

- Clear results only when the merchant clicks on the clear Button with the `<IconXCircle />` inside the Search field or manually erases the search terms.
- Maintain the previous results visible until the new ones finish loading.
- Don’t use local storage or cookies to store the search query.

### Error feedback

When the search doesn’t return results due to an error, use the DataView component to correctly display the feedback.

### No results feedback

When the search works but returns empty because there are no results matching the query, use the DataView component to correctly display the feedback.

### Supporting search operators

Avoid supporting search operators. Even though they are powerful, they aren’t discoverable and can be complex for most merchants. Prefer using Filters as a way to combine criteria.

### Logic

- Ignore typos, capitalization, and accents.
- Support synonyms.
- Don’t include a Search field for each type of information that can be searched, support all of them in the same input.

## Content

### Placeholder text

- In most cases, the experience should be intuitive enough not to need instructions on what should be searched. Only customize the placeholder text after UX research to understand the merchants’ needs.
- Describe the properties that can be searched when they go beyond the merchant’s expectations. For example, *Search for Name, ID, or Ref ID*.
- Considering localization, prioritize the properties that are most relevant according to UX research. For example, *Search for Name, ID, Ref ID, and more*.
- When a Table column has a label for the same property, reuse the name to maintain consistency.
- Don’t use placeholder text to include important information, since it will be hidden when the merchant types search terms.
- Avoid redundancy. Instead of writing *Product name* and *Product ID* on a *Products* page, write *Name* and *ID*.
- Avoid writing more than 36 characters.
- Don’t customize the width of the Search input on DataView to make the custom placeholder fit.
- Avoid adding support to search for properties that are not being shown for each result.

### Icon

Always show `<IconMagnifyingGlassSmall/>` to ensure the Search input is easily recognizable by merchants.

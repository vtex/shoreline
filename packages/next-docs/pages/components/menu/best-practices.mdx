# Best Practices

## Components

### Menu vs. Tab, Button, or a group of Buttons

- **Tab:** use for navigation triggers that alternate between related views within the same container.
- **Button:** use when there is only one action trigger.
- **Group of Buttons:** use when the group will not be repeated in a list and all its actions are frequently used.

## Variants

### More Actions or Custom Label

- **More Actions:** use when it represents a group of different actions related to the same object. For example, a `More Actions` menu in a promotion table row that includes the items *Edit*, *Duplicate*, *Deactivate*, and *Archive*.
- **Custom Label:** use when it represents an action with complementary options. For example, a Menu with the label *Create promotion* that includes the items *Regular*, *Buy together,* and *More for less*.

### Primary or Tertiary

- Understand how frequently merchants use an action.
- When the most frequent action of the page leads to a menu with complementary options, use a `primary` Menu. For example, a Menu with the *Create page* label that leads to options such as Landing page and Category page.
- There should be only one `primary` action visible at a time.
- When the same Menu is repeated, such as for each list item, use a `tertiary` Menu.
- When there is a group of tertiary Buttons and a Menu, they all should be `tertiary`.
- When the container background uses the `$bg-muted` color, use a `tertiary` Menu.

### Size

Use the `large` size for all `primary` Menu components. Use the `normal` size for `tertiary` Menu components.

### Icon position

- When using the `More actions` menu, the icon is always positioned to the left.
- When using the `Custom label` menu, the icon is always positioned to the right.

### Critical Menu Item

- When the Menu Item triggers an irreversible action, use a `critical` Menu Item. Actions should be reversible whenever possible and not require a critical color.
- Don’t use critical colors for *Move to trash* triggers that imply the possibility of reverting the action.

## Position

### More than one Menu

- Use more than one Menu component in a list when it is necessary to repeat the same set of actions for different objects. For example, in each row of a table.
- Don't use more than one Menu in the same container.

### Position in a container

Considering left-to-right interfaces:

- Align the Menu to the right. For example, a Menu in a Card's header should be vertically centered and aligned to the right.
- In a group of actions, position the Menu as the last action.
- When a `tertiary` Menu is next to other content, ignore the Menu's box to align based on the Menu's icon and/or label. Use the bleed prop to implement this alignment.

## Behavior

### Disabled Menu

Never use a disabled Menu. Leave the Menu enabled and disable the items inside according to our recommendations.

### Disabled Menu Item

- Use a `disabled` Menu Item only if, in some condition, it becomes enabled. For example, a *Publish* button that is only enabled when edits have been made.
- When the reason why an action is disabled might be unclear, leave the action enabled and show a modal explaining the reason on trigger.
- Don't display a Tooltip when hovering a disabled Menu Item.

## Content

### Menu label

- The `More actions` menu label is always *More actions*.
- The `Custom label` menu allows a custom label. For example, a Menu with the label *Create page* that includes the options *Landing page* and *Category page*.

When writing a custom label:

- Reuse existing labels.
- Always include a verb in the infinitive and an object. For example, *Create product*.
- Use a verb that reflects the exact action that the Menu triggers for every Menu Item. For example, use the label *Create promotion* for a Menu where the items are the different promotion types that can be created.
- Use sentence case but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don’t use punctuation, more than three words, or personal pronouns.

### Menu Item label

- Reuse existing labels.
- If the item is inside a `More actions` menu, always include a verb in the infinitive.
- If the item is inside a `Custom label` menu, don't use a verb. The action is already defined in the Menu label.
- When the context already has a label for the object, remove the object from the label. For example, use *Edit* instead of *Edit product*.
- Leave the object explicit when the Menu has the same action for different objects, such as *Edit product* and *Edit SKUs*.
- Use a verb that reflects the exact action that the Menu Item triggers. For example, use *Rename* instead of *Change name*.
- Use sentence case but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don’t use punctuation, more than three words, or personal pronouns.

### Menu Items icons

- Menu items inside a `More actions` menu always have icons.
- Menu Items inside a `Custom label` menu never have icons, since they will always trigger variations of the action that is in the Menu label.

### Icon Only Menu

- Use an icon only `More actions` menu when the same Menu is repeated multiple times on a screen, such as for each list item.
- Don't hide the label of a Menu with a custom label.
- Don’t use a Tooltip to display the label.

### Divider

Use a divider to separate regular actions from destructive actions. For example, a *Delete* action in a Menu should be the last one, and there should be a divider above it.

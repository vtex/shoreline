# Best Practices

## Components

### Pagination vs. infinite scroll

Use Pagination when a list can have more than 25 results. Infinite scroll is not recommended in any scenario.

## Position

### Position in a container

Considering left-to-right interfaces:

- Pagination should always be in the top right of a container.
- If the list has a vertical scroll, the Pagination should also be in the bottom right.
- Use the Data View component to correctly position the Pagination.

## Behavior

### Items shown per page

- The standard is to show 25 items per page of a list.
- When the list is inside a container where vertical scroll should be avoided, such as a Modal or a Card, limit the amount of items accordingly.
- In a Data View, merchants can select the number of results to be shown per page in the footer Pagination. They can choose among 10, 25, 50, and 100 results.

### Loading

Show a loading Pagination when the list is loading, since the number of results is not loaded and the user can’t navigate between pages yet.

### Updating the number of results

- Update the number of results when the merchant edits the filter values or the search query, the total number of results should inform the current state of the list.
- Only load new items when the merchant explicitly triggers an action to update the results, such as the *Refresh* button in the web browser.
- When the user has just created an item and returns to the listing page, they should go to the first page with updated results.
- When the user has just edited an item and returns to the listing page, they should see a list with the same items as before, but with the edited item updated.
- Don’t load new items while the merchant is navigating between pages.

### Storing the current state of a list in the URL

- The complete search query, which includes the filters, the current page, and the search terms, should be reflected in the URL. This allows the merchant to easily return to the customized view and easily share it.
- Don’t use local storage or cookies to store the query.

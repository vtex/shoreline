# Best Practices

## Components

### Tag vs. Select Inline, Switch or Text

- **Select Inline:** use when there are more than two possible values and the merchant can alternate between them.
- **Switch:** use when the value is the state of an item and there are two possible values that can be alternated.
- **Text:** use when the value can't be edited, doesn't require prominence and isn't positioned next to another value.

## Variants

### Color

- `gray`: use for values that can't be classified, such as *Category page*, and for values that require less attention, such as *Archived*.
- `blue`: use for information about the system that doesn't require the merchant to act, such as *Indexing*.
- `red`: use for values that require the merchant to act, such as *Error*, or for negative information, such as *Canceled*.
- `orange`: use for values that reflect a pending action from the merchant unrelated to an error, such as *Draft*.
- `green`: use for values that indicate that an item is matching or surpassing expectations, such as *Active*.
- `cyan`, `teal`, `purple` or `pink`: use for values without a clear semantic that can benefit from visual prominence or that should be visually differentiated by the merchant, such as app categories.

### Size

- `normal`: use next to `$text-body`, `$title-display3`, or `$title-display4` text.
- `large`: use next to `$title-display1` or `$title-display2` text.

### Prominence

- `regular`: use when the information provided by the tag is as relevant as other information in the interface.
- `high`: use when the tag has a high prominence in the interface and it should highlight very important information for the merchant.

## Position

### Position in a container

- Position the Tag close to related information, such as a title or label.
- Clear blank space around the Tag of at least `$space-3` horizontally and `$space-2` vertically.
- Separate multiple Tags with `$space-3` when listed horizontally and `$space-2` when listed vertically.
- In a Table, Tags should be one of the last columns, immediately before any column with Menu triggers.
- In the header of a container, position the Tag on the right side of the title and left-aligned.
- Don't apply bleed to the Tag. Prefer to position the Tag by its container.
- Don't position the Tag on the top-right of a container. Prefer to position the Tag next to a title or label.

## Behavior

### Hover or Click

- When hovering or clicking a Tag nothing should happen, because the Tag should not be clickable, removable, or editable.
- Don't open a Tooltip when a Tag is hovered.

## Content

### Label

- Write a property, such as *Active*, or a category, such as *Product page*.
- Write as short and direct of a label as possible. For example, write *Pending payment* instead of *Waiting for payment*.
- Use sentence case.
- Don't write text longer than 30 characters.
- Don't use punctuation or separators. For example, write only *Active* instead of *Status: active*.

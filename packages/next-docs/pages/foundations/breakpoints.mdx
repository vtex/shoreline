## Definition

Defines which layout will be applied to a container when it reaches a certain size.

## Rationale

### Purpose

- **Merchants should have the best experience for their devices and screen resolution.**<br />
  A merchant should always interact with an easily scannable interface with great usability. Besides, designing screens for smaller screen sizes is always a good design exercise that helps understand what is the most relevant content in an interface. This is why we consider the default size `~767px`, and we provide a breakpoint for screen sizes that are still uncommon in usage data, such as `$breakpoint-small`.
- **It should be comfortable to scan and read content in any screen resolution.**<br />
  To improve usability, interfaces should be consistent in content organization and visual rhythm, and different types of content should occupy different areas of a page. This is why we provide a column grid for each combination of breakpoint and max-width variation, and content occupies a max-width of at most 1500px on any screen.

### Application

- **Designers should be able to preview how an interface will be in different resolutions.**<br />
  When it's time to specify a screen for implementation, designers should prototype the main flow interfaces in different resolutions to guarantee the best experience for merchants. The designer and developer can align the interface's behavior with those assets. This is why we provide specific screen sizes in Figma for prototyping.
- **Breakpoints should be simple to implement.**<br />
  It isn't scalable to have a lot of breakpoint values for very specific devices, and they wouldn't be easy to maintain in code. When designing for different breakpoints, we shouldn't have any differences in content, and there should be only a few differences in layout for optimization. This is why we provide a few strategic breakpoint values.
- **The Admin interface should be responsive to preferences that Merchants have defined.**<br />
  Instead of applying zoom to each interface, users who prefer or need a different font size have a native setting they can adjust in most browsers. A website responds to this setting if its dimensions in CSS are defined with a relative unit. This is why [we use the rem unit](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#media-queries-7) — instead of the trickier em unit — to specify typography, spacing, and breakpoint tokens.
- **Admin breakpoints must consider the sidebar, the grid, and the content max width.**<br />
  We calculated the iFrame area for the resolutions most used by current Admin users and [worldwide](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats), considering a 280px sidebar, the margins defined by our grid, and the content max-width of 1500px on any screen. This is why we implement breakpoints in the iFrame using [container queries](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) and don't have very large breakpoints such as 1920px.

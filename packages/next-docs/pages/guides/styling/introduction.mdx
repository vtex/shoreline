# Introduction

This documentation aims to explain how the styling using shoreline components works. It is intended for developers who want to customize the look and feel of applications.

By default every component doesn't have any style applied. Instead they have an architecture that respond to the `data-attributes` and `tokens` defined in the [Theme](/guides/theming/introduction). 

In the next sections you will understand how this architecture works and how to use it to create your own styles.

## Overview

**Styleguide**

Current Design System, the home for all our reusable patterns, components, and assets related to product design in VTEX. It is a common language of tools and processes to facilitate how we collaborate and share knowledge across teams and projects.

**Admin UI**

A library of React components with a focus on accessibility and developer experience.

We also have other packages that are responsible for providing the entire structure used by our library. Some of them are: [Theme](/guidelines/theming/), [Iconography](/foundations/icons), and [Core](#).

## About CSS styles

**Styleguide**

Functional CSS using [VTEX Tachyons](https://vtex.github.io/vtex-tachyons/).

**Admin UI**

We use [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) to implement a CSS-like, and prop-based model of styling components.

## Overriding Styles

In most applications, it is a common challenge to override styles for a specific context to match design requirements.

**Styleguide**

Given that Styleguide uses [VTEX Tachyons](https://vtex.github.io/vtex-tachyons/) as a CSS utility framework, you may need to rewrite the tachyons config to override specific `classNames`. In Styleguide, there is no easy way to do this.

**Admin UI**

Given that Admin UI styles are prop-based, overrides are as easy as passing a property.

```jsx isStatic
<Card csx={{ padding: 2 }}>Card content</Card>

<Button csx={{ border: 'default' }}>Label</Button>
```

## Responsive Design

**Styleguide**

Authoring responsive styles in Styleguide requires a combination of pseudo-classes.

```jsx isStatic
<div className="w-10 w-30-m w-40-l">{content}</div>
```

**Admin UI**

Every [StyleObject](/guidelines/styling/) property can receive a responsive value, for example:

```jsx isStatic
<Box csx={{ width: ['10%', '30%', '40%'] }} />
```

## Accessibility

**Styleguide**

Many components do not support accessibility requirements, some of which are very difficult to provide.

**Admin UI**

We always build our components thinking about accessibility first and use two libraries for that: [Reakit Library](http://reakit.io/) and [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/).

## Typography

It is important to define different typography styles for an app by setting a combination of different typography attributes: **Typeface**, **weight**, **size**, **capitalization** and **letter spacing**.

**Styleguide**

Comes with a set of `classNames` to apply the typography attributes.

```jsx isStatic
<p className="t-body lh-copy">This is a paragraph!</p>
```

**Admin UI**

Provides the [VTEX Trust font](/foundations/typography) and comes with a set of components and CSS properties that turns the application of the typography attributes easier.

```jsx isStatic
<Paragraph>This is a paragraph!</Paragraph>

<Heading>This is a Heading!</Heading>

<Text variant="subtitle">Text with subtitle style!</Heading>

<h1 className={cn({ text: 'headline' })}>This is a Heading!</h1>
```

## Iconography

**Styleguide**

Exports a set of icons, most of them are not well documented.

**Admin UI**

Exports a set of [Icons](/foundations/icons) divided into categories according to their usage. It also has some features that our library provides. For example:

- **Icons with direction:** Some icons have a state that allows the developer to control their direction (left, right, down, up).

- **Custom Icon:** We export an `Icon` component that allows the developer to create a custom icon using our structure.

## Charts

**Styleguide**

Comes with a set of chart components ready to be used.

**Admin UI**

Not yet available. Will be implemented in the future.

## State

**Styleguide**

Most of the components have their states self-contained.

```jsx isStatic
function Example() {
  const [state, setState] = useState('Item 1')

  const options = [
    { value: 'Item 1', label: '1' },
    { value: 'Item 2', label: '2' },
    { value: 'Item 3', label: '3' },
  ]

  return (
    <Dropdown
      label="dropdown"
      options={options}
      value={state}
      onChange={(_, v) => setState(v)}
    />
  )
}
```

**Admin UI**

We export the entire state control using react hooks.

```jsx isStatic
function Example() {
  const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']
  const state = useDropdownState({ items, initialSelectedItem: 'Item 1' })
  return <Dropdown items={items} state={state} label="dropdown" />
}
```

## Reuse Design Behavior

**Styleguide**

The component's styles are made combining Tachyons classNames, so to reuse the design behavior we need to combine the same tokens.

**Admin UI**

Components csx can be applied using a valid path on our theme object, we call this path of theme key. There are several ways to reuse design behavior in our system. For example:

- Using the `themeKey` property inside the [Styles object](/guidelines/styling/).
- Using [stylesOf](/hooks/use-system/#stylesof) function.
- Accessing our theme object. You can do that either using the [useTheme hook](#) or calling our [theme function](/guidelines/styling/#functions) inside a style object.

## Utilities

**Styleguide**

Style patterns are not mapped.

**Admin UI**

We map styles that are repeated in the admin applications and create patterns from that. There are two ways of using those utilities:

### Components

**Flex:** You don't have to repeat the `display: 'flex'` every time and it comes with shorthands properties to apply Flexbox CSS behavior.

**Grid & GridItem:** You don't have to repeat the `display: 'grid'` every time and it comes with shorthands properties to apply Grid CSS behavior.

**Set:** Handles all the CSS logic to apply spacing between its children, `flex-direction`, and all of that as easy as using two properties.

### Custom CSS Properties

**Border:**

```jsx isStatic
// without token
<div
  className={cn({
    borderBottom: 'solid',
    borderBottomWidth: '1px',
    borderBottomColor: 'mid.secondary',
  })}
/>

// with token
<div className={cn({ border: 'divider-bottom' })} />
```

**Size:**

```jsx isStatic
// without token
<div className={cn({ width: 100, height: 100 })} />

// with token
<div className={cn({ size: 100 })} />
```

**Text:**

```jsx isStatic
// without token
<div
  className={cn({
    fontFamily: 'sans',
    lineHeight: 'headline',
    fontSettings: 'regular',
    fontSize: 4,
  })}
/>

// with token
<div className={cn({ text: 'headline' })} />
```

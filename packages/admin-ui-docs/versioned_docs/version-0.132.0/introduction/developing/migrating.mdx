## Overview

**Styleguide**

Current Design System, the home for all our reusable patterns, components, and assets related to product design in VTEX. It is a common language of tools and processes to facilitate how we collaborate and share knowledge across teams and projects.

**Admin UI**

A library of React components with a focus on accessibility and developer experience.

We also have other packages that are responsible for providing the entire structure used by our library.

## About CSS styles

**Styleguide**

Functional CSS using [VTEX Tachyons](https://vtex.github.io/vtex-tachyons/).

**Admin UI**

We use [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) to implement a CSS-like, and prop-based model of styling components.

## Overriding Styles

In most applications, it is a common challenge to override styles for a specific context to match design requirements.

**Styleguide**

Given that Styleguide uses [VTEX Tachyons](https://vtex.github.io/vtex-tachyons/) as a CSS utility framework, you may need to rewrite the tachyons config to override specific `classNames`. In Styleguide, there is no easy way to do this.

**Admin UI**

Given that Admin UI styles are prop-based, overrides are as easy as passing a property.

```jsx isStatic
<Card csx={{ padding: '$s' }}>Card content</Card>

<Button csx={{ border: 'default' }}>Label</Button>
```

## Responsive Design

**Styleguide**

Authoring responsive styles in Styleguide requires a combination of pseudo-classes.

```jsx isStatic
<div className="w-10 w-30-m w-40-l">{content}</div>
```

**Admin UI**

Every [StyleObject](/teams/developing/styling/) property can receive a responsive value, for example:

```jsx isStatic
<Box csx={{ width: ['10%', '30%', '40%'] }} />
```

## Accessibility

**Styleguide**

Many components do not support accessibility requirements, some of which are very difficult to provide.

**Admin UI**

We always build our components thinking about accessibility first and use two libraries for that: [Reakit Library](http://reakit.io/) and [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/).

## Typography

It is important to define different typography styles for an app by setting a combination of different typography attributes: **Typeface**, **weight**, **size**, **capitalization** and **letter spacing**.

**Styleguide**

Comes with a set of `classNames` to apply the typography attributes.

```jsx isStatic
<p className="t-body lh-copy">This is a paragraph!</p>
```

**Admin UI**

Provides the [VTEX Trust font](/guidelines/foundations/typography) and comes with a set of components and CSS properties that turns the application of the typography attributes easier.

```jsx isStatic
<Paragraph>This is a paragraph!</Paragraph>

<Heading>This is a Heading!</Heading>

<Text variant="subtitle">Text with subtitle style!</Heading>

<h1 className={cn({ text: 'headline' })}>This is a Heading!</h1>
```

## Iconography

**Styleguide**

Exports a set of icons, most of them are not well documented.

**Admin UI**

Exports a set of [Icons](/guidelines/foundations/icons) divided into categories according to their usage. It also has some features that our library provides. For example:

- **Icons with direction:** Some icons have a state that allows the developer to control their direction (left, right, down, up).

- **Custom Icon:** We export an `Icon` component that allows the developer to create a custom icon using our structure.

## Charts

**Styleguide**

Comes with a set of chart components ready to be used.

**Admin UI**

Not yet available. Will be implemented in the future.

## State

**Styleguide**

Most of the components have their states self-contained.

```jsx isStatic
function Example() {
  const [state, setState] = useState('Item 1')

  const options = [
    { value: 'Item 1', label: '1' },
    { value: 'Item 2', label: '2' },
    { value: 'Item 3', label: '3' },
  ]

  return (
    <Dropdown
      label="dropdown"
      options={options}
      value={state}
      onChange={(_, v) => setState(v)}
    />
  )
}
```

**Admin UI**

We export the entire state control using react hooks.

```jsx isStatic
function Example() {
  const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']
  const state = useDropdownState({ items, initialSelectedItem: 'Item 1' })
  return <Dropdown items={items} state={state} label="dropdown" />
}
```

## Reuse Design Behavior

**Styleguide**

The component's styles are made combining Tachyons classNames, so to reuse the design behavior we need to combine the same tokens.

**Admin UI**

Style reuse is done with [Design Tokens](/guidelines/foundations/design-tokens), which are based on semantic context and make the styling consistent throughout different apps.
Admin UI also provides layout components for common layout styling cases like `Bleed`, `Stack` and `Inline`, using them reduces the
constant repetition of positioning css or classNames. Since these components accept the csx prop for aditional styling they also
allow for merging other styles into the layout.

## Utilities

**Styleguide**

Style patterns are not mapped.

**Admin UI**

We map styles that are repeated in the admin applications and create patterns from that. There are two ways of using those utilities:

### Components

**Flex:** You don't have to repeat the `display: 'flex'` every time and it comes with shorthands properties to apply Flexbox CSS behavior.

**Grid & GridItem:** You don't have to repeat the `display: 'grid'` every time and it comes with shorthands properties to apply Grid CSS behavior.

**Set:** Handles all the CSS logic to apply spacing between its children, `flex-direction`, and all of that as easy as using two properties.

### Custom CSS Properties

**Border:**

```jsx isStatic
// without token
<div
  className={cn({
    borderBottom: 'solid',
    borderBottomWidth: '1px',
    borderBottomColor: 'mid.secondary',
  })}
/>

// with token
<div className={cn({ border: 'divider-bottom' })} />
```

**Size:**

```jsx isStatic
// without token
<div className={cn({ width: 100, height: 100 })} />

// with token
<div className={cn({ size: 100 })} />
```

**Text:**

```jsx isStatic
// without token
<div
  className={cn({
    fontFamily: 'sans',
    lineHeight: 'headline',
    fontSettings: 'regular',
    fontSize: 4,
  })}
/>

// with token
<div className={cn({ text: 'headline' })} />
```

# Best Practices

Elevation tokens are divided in three types:

- **Focus Ring:** Identified by the prefix `$focus-ring`, followed by a suffix that indicates the semantic value according to the [Color](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/color/best-practices#surface) guidelines (base, accent, critical).
- **Shadow:** Identified by the prefix `$shadow`, followed by numeric suffixes in a crescent order.
- **Z-index:** Identified by the prefix `$z`, followed by numeric suffixes in a crescent order.

## Focus Ring

As explained in the [rationale](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/elevation/rationale), this is a web standard used in the focus state of interactive elements for users that prefer or require keyboard navigation.

| Token                  | Usage                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$focus-ring-base`     | Form fields, actions in neutral colors (`secondary` and `tertiary` Buttons, and items in a Menu), and popovers |
| `$focus-ring-accent`   | Actions in accent color (`primary` Buttons)                                                                    |
| `$focus-ring-critical` | Form fields in an error state and actions in critical colors (Critical Buttons and critical items in a Menu)   |

## Shadow

As mentioned in the [rationale](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/elevation/rationale), use these tokens to indicate that an element is over another and there is content hidden below it.

| Token       | Usage                    |
| :---------- | :----------------------- |
| `$shadow-1` | Popovers                 |
| `$shadow-2` | Modal, Drawer, and Toast |

## Z-index

This CSS property controls the stacking order of elements on a page, measured along a z-axis. An element with a higher z-index value appears in front of another with a lower z-index value. Elements in the Admin should be stacked as described below.

# Best Practices

Icons should communicate a message, so prioritize applying ones that are simple, easily recognizable, or well-established as conventions, and avoid metaphoric symbols.

In Shoreline, they are identified by the prefix `Icon` and their naming convention is `Icon[Name][Modifier]`. The name is always the same from the [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/) library and the modifier can be related to its weight or size. Most icons have a `normal` size and an `outline` weight, so these modifiers won't be mentioned in their names. The modifiers `fill` and `small` are always specified. For example, the `IconTag` is normal and outlined, `IconBellFill` is normal and filled, and `IconCheckSmall` is small and outlined.

## Modifiers

### Weight

![Icons weight](/assets/icons-weight.webp)

- **Outline:** Default weight (1.5px stroke, light weight in Phosphor) used in interactive elements (Button, Search, Sidebar sections).
- **Fill:** Used in non-interactive elements (Alerts, Toasts), for informative purposes.

### Size

![Icons size](/assets/icons-size.webp)

- **Normal:** Default size (20px) used in most scenarios (Button, Alert, Toast, Sidebar sections).
- **Small:** In-line appropriate size (16px) used for affordance purposes (caret in a Menu or Filter, arrow for external links).

## Usage

- Only modify the size of an icon when applying it as an [Empty State](https://shoreline.vtex.com/components/empty-state) illustration, maintaining the 1.5px stroke. Don't modify the size of an icon in other scenarios.
- If you want to represent an action with only an icon and no visible label, use the [IconButton](https://shoreline.vtex.com/components/icon-button).
- When applying color to an icon, follow the [Color](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/color) guidelines. Don't change the color of icons inside components, such as Buttons, Alerts, and Toasts.

## New icons

If there's no icon already in Shoreline that fits your needs, follow the [contribution guidelines](https://shoreline.vtex.com/guides/how-to-contribute) to request or propose one. As mentioned in the [rationale](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/icons/rationale), custom-designed icons are strongly discouraged to avoid inconsistency, but if there are no options in the Phosphor library we can start a discussion.

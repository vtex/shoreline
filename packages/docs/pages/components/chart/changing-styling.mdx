# Changing styling
> Shoreline Charts already provides colors and general styles for your charts, in most cases you should **not** modify these.

Most visual aspects can be changed in the `option` or `series` prop.
You can also override the default theme by modifying the `theme` prop. In general, reffer to the official echarts docs for visual configuration of components.

Legend behaviour and visuals can be returned to their default echarts settings by disabling the `checkboxLegendVisuals` and `checkboxLegendBehaviour` props.

Certain aspects might not be overridable, and can only be disabled by setting `chartConfig` to `null`.

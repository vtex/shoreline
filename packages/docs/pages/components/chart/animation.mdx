# Chart animation
Defined by `animationDelay`, `animationDuration` and `animationEasing`.

Delay and duration can receive number or functions. Functions can make every bar have different properties.

Easing receives a string indicating the [easing function](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=line-easing).

## Updating vs adding and removing
`animationDelay` and the others set the delay for when a point is added or removed. To change these properties for updated points we add the 'Update' suffix.

Generally update animations should be shorter.

## Performance
Animations are automatically disabled when a certain threshold of points is passed, so as to not hinder performance.

In _options_ `animationThreshold` configures this threshold, while `animation:false` turns any animation off.

# Chart hooks

The hooks are functions that are applied to the chart options to modify the chart options before it is rendered.
The component receives an array of hooks as a prop and applies them in the order they are passed.
All hook functions receive the chart options as a parameter and return the modified options.

## Execution Stack

The hooks are executed in the following order:

1. Default hooks
2. User hooks
3. Default Shoreline style options
4. User style options

This way, the user can modify the chart options and the features still will be calculated based on the user options.

## Example

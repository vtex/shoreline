# Synchronization/Grouping
Allows multiple charts in the same `group` to share events,
 meaning that when a tooltip is spawned by one of them (on mouse hover),
 all other charts in the same group will also spawn a tooltip, at that same serie.

 Toggling one chart's legend will also toggle all the others in the same group.

As many charts as desired can be part of the same group, so long as all of them have the same value in the `group` prop.
> Charts do not need to share the same series names or axis names for this feature to work.

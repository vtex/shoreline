# Best Practices

## Properties

### Variant

| Variant | Usage | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `info` | Message without a clear semantic that doesn't require immediate attention. | “There are 5 new transactions” with a View new transactions action, when in a page with outdated content |
| `critical` | Action that failed due to a technical error or a user error. Include a proposed action or, when it's not possible, explain what to do next. | "The font could not be deleted because it's used in styles. Please remove it from styles and try again." with a View styles action |
| `warning` | Unexpected behavior or something to be cautious about. Consider including a proposed action or explaining what to do next. | “The product was saved with 5 issues” and a Fix issues action |
| `positive` | Action that matched or surpassed expectations. If the action takes a while to process, use a positive Toast for the submission itself and an info Alert to indicate progress. | “Product successfully created” |

### Icon

Each Alert variant includes a specific semantic icon that should not be customized.

### Message

- Write a brief and direct sentence with 240 characters at most. Prefer to include an action that complements the message when needed.
- Don't use technical language. For example, use ”*The invoice could not be sent because of a technical issue”* instead of ”*Error 298dx9283 prevented the invoice from being sent”*.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't use personal pronouns.

### Action

Keep the message brief by including an action that complements it, such as to:

- Provide more details in a modal or related page.
- Retry a failed action.
- Undo a successful action.
- Focus on the first error in a form with issues.
- Refresh outdated information on the page.

Read the Button documentation for more details.

### Dismissible

Toasts are always dismissible. For non-dismissible notifications, read the Alert documentation.

## Position

- **Position in a container:** Considering left-to-right interfaces, Toasts pop from the bottom of the screen and rest on the lower right-hand corner. This is the default behavior and it should not be customized.
- **Multiple toasts:** Avoid displaying more than one Toast at the same time. Prefer to summarize the result of an action in a single Toast. For example, use ”*34 products successfully saved”*.

## Behavior

### Timing

- **Trigger:** Toasts appear immediately after an action is triggered (user presses *Save*) or the loading feedback is over (Button stops spinning).
- **Duration:** Most Toasts should last between 5 and 10 seconds, following an average of 175 milliseconds per character. Use a permanent toast only when they require attention, such as critical Toasts, warning Toasts, and any Toast that is not the immediate result of an user action.

# Design Migration

The transition from Admin UI to Shoreline 1.0 includes the update, addition, and removal of components. Understand what has changed and how to use the new resources.

## Library

A new library was created for Shoreline components in Figma, so the Admin UI components won't change to the Shoreline components automatically. Activate the [Shoreline – Components](https://www.figma.com/file/PWGSQ26U55u8E34JWn9ZYE/Shoreline-%E2%80%93-Components?type=design&node-id=1840%3A17704&mode=design&t=OETsXsw4sIAhEcfA-1) library in your file to start using the new components. In ongoing files that use Admin UI and that will now use Shoreline, we recommend that you deactivate the Admin UI library to avoid confusion when applying foundations and components.

## Migrating

Find below the list of Admin UI components and which Shoreline components and their variants replace them in Figma. If you want to know more about the components’ usage, consult their best practices documentation.

### Alert

The previous `info` and `positive` variants are now called `informational` and `success`, respectively.

### Page

The layout variants continue the same. Screen size variants were added.

### Pagination

The component exists with the same name.

### Popover

- Popover doesn't exist as a separate component in Figma. It exists in code and can be implemented.

Previous applications can be replaced with another more suitable component, such as a Checkbox if it is a binary selection that needs to be submitted, a Button if it represents an action that requires confirmation, or a custom solution.

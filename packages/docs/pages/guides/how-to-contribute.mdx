# How to contribute

You can contribute in several ways, depending on your interest and bandwidth.
Whether you want to volunteer for existing work or just submit an idea or report
a bug, there are processes to follow. Learn about them here.

## GitHub

### Issues

GitHub is where contributions will happen. Access the Shoreline [issues list](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/issues) to have a general view of what is happening and create new issues. Learn how to view and create issues in the video below.

### Project

Access the Shoreline [project](https://github.com/orgs/vtex/projects/61/views/1) to have a view of the existing issues organized by status, and also filtered views for Design tasks and Dev tasks.

- **No status:** Issues that still don't have any discussion.
- **Discussing:** Issues that have any discussions going on, including defining solutions in design or code. Check the issue [labels](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/labels) to understand the nature of the discussion ([bug](https://shoreline.vtex.com/guides/how-to-contribute#bug-report), [proposal](https://shoreline.vtex.com/guides/how-to-contribute#proposal), [idea](https://shoreline.vtex.com/guides/how-to-contribute#idea), or [question and feedback](https://shoreline.vtex.com/guides/how-to-contribute#question--feedback)), its subject, and if designer or developer inputs are needed.
- **Backlog:** Issues in which the discussion was concluded, a maintainer approved the solution, and they are ready to be implemented by anyone who volunteers. Feel free to reach out to the maintainers through the GitHub issue if you want to volunteer. Keep in mind that when taking a task from the backlog, you are responsible for it. Make sure to communicate with the maintainers if you have any questions or need help.
- **Active:** Issues for which someone has already volunteered to implement the solution and is already working on the tasks.
- **Done:** Issues that a maintainer reviewed, approved the changes, and merged the PR.

## Bug report

Reporting a bug means that you’ve found a potential problem with the library, in
Figma or code, and want to share it with the community or even propose a solution
for it.

![Bug report flow](/assets/bug-report.png)

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Open an issue

Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/issues/new/choose) and answer questions like what is the context, the problem you are facing, and the evidence you have. If you already
have a potential solution to this problem don’t forget to share it. Don't worry
if you aren’t sure about the issue! Share it and start a discussion as early
as possible.

For bug fixes in Figma, propose a solution by creating a branch in the library
with the name _Fix [Component or Icon name]_.

### Discussion

Get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue, on Figma, or by attending office hours. As you make progress, make sure to update your issue.

### Definition

As the discussions and refinements occur, your issue can be classified by a maintainer as valid to
be resolved or not. If it is valid, these are the following steps:

- **Figma bugs:** Prepare the handoff following the
  [guidelines](https://shoreline.vtex.com/guides/design/handoff-requirements) and post the files in the issue. A maintainer will review, approve, and merge the component or icon branch in the Figma library.
- **Code bugs:** A maintainer will review and approve the solution.

When the issue is in great shape and includes the necessary information and/or files to be implemented, it will be moved to the [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/vtex/projects/61) column by a maintainer.

</Steps>

## Proposal

Submitting a proposal means that you've already created a solution for a problem and want to share it with the community.

![Proposal flow](/assets/feature-proposal.png)

Your proposal can have two origins:
- **You have already created a solution for your context needs and want to start a discussion
about it.** Remember to question yourself before submitting the proposal if the
solution brings significant value to Shoreline and its users.
- **You find an existing issue with a `design wanted` or `dev wanted` label and
volunteer yourself to work on it.** Before moving on with volunteering, ask
yourself if you're clear on the scope of the project, if the task is feasible for
you to do, and if you would need to collaborate with someone else. Feel free to
ask any questions!

If everything is clear, move on with submitting your proposal.

<Steps>

### Open an issue

Use the [proposal template](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/issues/new/choose) and answer questions like the problem you
are solving, your solution, and the references you had. If the proposal is
related to an existing issue, remember to mention it. Don't worry if your proposal
is not finalized yet! Share it and start a discussion as early as possible.

For proposals in Figma, create a branch in the library
with the name _Add [Component or Icon name]_ or _Update [Component or Icon name]_.

### Discussion

You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue or by attending office hours.
As you make progress, make sure to update your issue.

## Question & Feedback

Asking a question or sending a feedback means that you have something to share with
maintainers or the community that probably is bothering you. Feel free to reach
us anytime you need!

![Question and Feedback flow](/assets/question-feedback.png)

<Steps>

### Open an issue

Use the [question template](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/issues/new/choose) and answer important questions about your submission
like how we can help, what have you tried, and any additional information. Don't
be shy! Share it and start a discussion as early as possible.

### Discussion

You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue or by attending office hours. Make sure to share
all the necessary information about the feature so the community can help giving
insights and sharing their context as well. As you make progress, make sure to
update your issue.

### Definition

The idea here is that your issue act as a forum for discussion and resource for
others that might have the same question. If the issue is resolved, a maintainer
will close it.

Your question or feedback can be used as a reference for an idea for enhancement or potential bug fix. Then, it will follow the processes according to its nature.

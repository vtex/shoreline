### Branch in Figma library

Create a branch in the [Shoreline – Components](https://www.figma.com/file/PWGSQ26U55u8E34JWn9ZYE/Shoreline-%E2%80%93-Components?type=design) Figma library adding the new component with the name *Add [Component name]*, and using the [component section template](https://www.figma.com/file/1rQH2tU85kYEYRHRoAP5gZ/InnerSource-%E2%80%93-Design-Templates?type=design&node-id=5%3A6&mode=design&t=p7YfrIpPzse68e3F-1) when adding the component.

### Specs file

#### How to fill in the implementation specifications?
Ask yourself which aspects of the component may cause doubts during implementation or could go unnoticed. Remember that the instructions added to the file will guide a frontend developer on how to better implement the component, so be as detailed as possible.

- Include the component name, description, and a link to the best practices and related components documentation.
- Include examples detailing the variants, specially the ones that are not exposed in the component itself.
- List anything specific to tokens usage in the component.
- Specify any element that is optional in the component.
- If the component includes icons or labels, specify if they can be replaced or if there are any restrictions.
- Include examples detailing how the elements behave when the component changes size.
- Specify the component spacing and bleed usage.
- Detail when a different cursor than the default should be displayed when overlaying an element.
- Detail when a component should have a z-index different from the applied default.
- Detail max/min or height/width, when they are applied.
- Suggest when it is possible to localize a text string in the component.

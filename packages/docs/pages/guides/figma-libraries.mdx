# Figma Libraries

The Shoreline Figma libraries includes all the resources designers need to quickly assemble a prototype and create coherent experiences for merchants. For more information on how to apply the styles and components in these libraries, please refer to [tokens](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations), [icons](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/icons), and [components](https://shoreline.vtex.com/components) documentation.

## VTEX users

If you are a VTEX designer, you already have access to the organization in Figma. If you don't have access to Figma, use the IT workflow to request it. Once in Figma, the Shoreline team is open and anyone has viewer access to it. Consider that even VTEX designers don't have edit access to the libraries.

Use the libraries below in your files.

import { Cards } from 'nextra/components'
import { IconLinkSimple } from '@vtex/shoreline'

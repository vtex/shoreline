This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that makes use of Shoreline's [Next.js Integration](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/tree/dev/packages/raccoon-next) and [Design System](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/tree/dev/packages/admin-ui).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
